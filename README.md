# Click-Counter
Simple Click Counter for iOS written programmatically

Created using:<br/>
Swift Version 4.2 <br/>
XCode Version 10.1

This simple app creates a simple counter with a plus and minus button to increment or decrement from 0.  Every even number will result in the background and counter text color to change.  

The app works on all devices, taking advantage of code to use auto layout, instead of storyboard.  It works also in portrait and landscape orientations. 

Files:<br/>
MainVC.swift - Main ViewController that implements the counter and updates to the view when clicked.<br/>
AppDelegate.swift - Application Delegate which indicates the root view controller.<br/>
